gpmri01 - procedure to get it ready for datastore mount
owl - procedure to get it ready for datastore mount (I had trouble with the same procedure)
krb5.conf - file for kerberos
nfs-common - file for nfs
smb.conf - file for samba
merge - two options to get access to datastore (I chose option #2)
kerberos-local-ubuntu - something weird about kerberos on ubuntu. To add a local account, I will have to follow this recipe.
